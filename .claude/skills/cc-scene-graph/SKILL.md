description: Use for Cocos scene/project structural search, composite node resolution, bounded hierarchy navigation, asset references, or session continuation. Uses the offline T0/T1 graph and requires a live read before every mutation.

# cc-scene-graph

Offline structural navigation for saved Cocos assets. The graph answers **where/what**; Cocos Pilot remains authoritative for unsaved state, runtime state, and every write.

## Authority model

- T0 identity: engine UUID plus source file. Indexed as composite `handle = <file>#<uuid>`.
- T1 structure: saved hierarchy, component attachment, script identity, asset references. Indexed.
- T2 mutable values: transforms, active state, component values. Never indexed.
- T3 runtime/editor state: selection, viewport, undo, runtime instances. Never indexed.

Node UUIDs and prefab `fileId` values are file-local. Never pass a composite handle (`<file>#<uuid>`) as a live mutation handle. Resolve its engine UUID, then confirm the exact live scene/target through the same bound Cocos Pilot endpoint and project. T0 identity and T1 structure are advisory navigation evidence only, never mutation permission.

## Cache layout

The graph cache is project-scoped and lives under the Creator project:

```text
<project>/.cocos-graph/cocos-pilot/
```

For CLI use, `--isolate` or `CC_GRAPH_ISOLATE=1` selects a branch/worktree namespace; `CC_GRAPH_SLUG` overrides its slug. `--out` wins over `CC_GRAPH_OUT`, which wins over isolation defaults. Builds use a bounded namespace lock and atomic generation publication.

## Commands

```bash
# Build all bundles or exactly one bundle
node tools/cocos-graph/bin/cocos-graph.mjs build --project <project> [--bundle <bundle>] [--isolate]

# Overlay one expanded live scene; JSON must include sourceFile, tree, dirty
node tools/cocos-graph/bin/cocos-graph.mjs build --project <project> --bundle <bundle> --live-json <snapshot.json> --isolate

# Search; filters compose with AND
node tools/cocos-graph/bin/cocos-graph.mjs query --project <project> --bundle <bundle> [--by-component <type>] [--by-script <uuid>] [--component-id <id>] [--path-glob <path>] [--text <q>] [--explain] [--limit 50] [--cursor 0] --isolate

# Resolve identity; ambiguous bare UUID exits 3 and returns candidates
node tools/cocos-graph/bin/cocos-graph.mjs resolve --project <project> --bundle <bundle> --handle <file#uuid> --isolate
node tools/cocos-graph/bin/cocos-graph.mjs resolve --project <project> --bundle <bundle> --uuid <engine-id> --isolate

# Bounded hierarchy navigation
node tools/cocos-graph/bin/cocos-graph.mjs navigate --project <project> --bundle <bundle> --handle <file#uuid> --relation ancestors|children|descendants [--depth 1] [--limit 50] --isolate

# Asset references from component properties
node tools/cocos-graph/bin/cocos-graph.mjs refs --project <project> --bundle <bundle> --asset-uuid <uuid> --isolate

# Integrity/schema validation
node tools/cocos-graph/bin/cocos-graph.mjs validate --project <project> --bundle <bundle> --isolate
```

Parser schema is v4. v3 or older manifests fail with an explicit rebuild action.

## Required mutation workflow

When the graph capability is available on the bound endpoint:

1. Use `ccbi:ccp3x_<port>.graphManage(query/resolve)` to find a candidate and resolve its composite `<file>#<uuid>` to a bare engine UUID. Keep file/source/bundle provenance for verification.
2. Treat T0 identity and T1 structure as advisory only. They do not authorize a write; stale, dirty/unknown, opaque, ambiguous, or mismatched results require stopping or fresh investigation.
3. On that same `ccbi` and project, confirm the binding's `bd.iid` is still current. Use `sceneGetInfo` to verify the intended scene, then `nodeGetTree` or inspector to verify the exact target live.
4. Pass only the bare engine UUID—not `<file>#<uuid>`—to the narrow live mutation tool. Make only the requested bounded change.
5. Read the target back live through the same endpoint and verify the observable result before reporting success.

The agent workflow above is an instruction for the capability when exposed; it is not evidence that a release is registered or qualified live. See the CLI commands below for offline graph operations.

For CLI-driven session continuity, record only after the live read-back above:

```bash
node tools/cocos-graph/bin/cocos-graph.mjs session-record \
  --project <project> --bundle <bundle> --scene-uuid <scene-uuid> \
  --working-path <path> --task <description> --verified
```

`session-record` rejects calls without `--verified`; it writes `.claude/ccp-session.json` atomically with `age_ms:0`.


### Tool Selection Matrix (Avoiding "Node tree not found")

| Target Source | Tool to Read Structure | Tool to Inspect Properties | Live nodeGetTree Allowed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open Scene (`sceneGetInfo` matches) | `nodeGetTree` | `inspectorGet` | **YES** |
| Unopened `.scene` file | `cocos-graph navigate` or open via `sceneOpen` | `sceneOpen` then `inspectorGet` | **NO** (Must call `sceneOpen` first) |
| `.prefab` file on disk | `readPrefabJson` or `cocos-graph navigate` | `inspectorGet` with asset UUID | **NO** (Prefab is not active scene; `nodeGetTree` will throw 404 `TARGET_NOT_FOUND`) |
| Composite handle (`file#uuid`) | Strip to bare `uuid` only after verifying `file` is open | `inspectorGet` with bare `uuid` | **NO** (Must strip `file#` prefix) |
## Live snapshot contract

```json
{
  "sourceFile": "assets/<bundle>/<scene>.scene",
  "dirty": true,
  "tree": { "reference": {}, "children": [] }
}
```

The source file must resolve uniquely inside the selected bundle. Live records replace only that scene; unrelated disk scene/prefab records remain. Missing or ambiguous provenance fails before publication.

## Output and failure semantics

- Query results are deterministically ordered and cursor-paginated.
- Every handle includes `handle`, engine `uuid`, `file`, `source`, and `bundle`.
- `resolve --uuid` never guesses: one candidate resolves, duplicates return `ambiguous` plus candidates.
- `dirty:"unknown"` is advisory, never equivalent to clean.
- `prefabOpaque:true` means disk parsing omitted expanded prefab internals.
- Exit 0 + `total:0` means a valid empty result.
- Exit 2 means missing/stale/invalid data or bad arguments.
- Exit 3 means ambiguous bare identity.

## Do not

- Never cache or write T2 values from the graph.
- Never treat bare node UUID as global identity.
- Never use serialized positional `__id__` as identity.
- Never mutate from offline evidence without the live-read and post-write witness.
- Never dump an entire scene when a bounded query or navigation command answers the question.
- Never add SQLite, embeddings, or offline prefab expansion without measured need and correctness fixtures.
